# Brain Tumor Detection

This project was developed as part of a **group assignment** for the *Image Processing* subject.  
It focuses on detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning.

## Project Overview

- Utilizes pretrained models to classify brain tumor types
- Based on medical image data processed through neural networks
- Implemented using Python with TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch

## Team & Contributions

This was a collaborative project with [@debbiefyx](https://github.com/debbiefyx).

**My contributions included:**
- Preprocessing MRI datasets
- Assisting in training and tuning the ResNet model
- Evaluating performance metrics and generating visualizations
- Writing documentation and preparing model release files

## Pretrained Models

The repository includes two pretrained models:

- `resnet.h5` â€“ Trained using TensorFlow/Keras
- `best.pt` â€“ Trained using PyTorch

## How to Use

1. Download the pretrained models from the [latest release](https://github.com/debbiefyx/brain_tumor_detection/releases/tag/v1.0)
2. Extract the `.zip` file if needed:
   ```bash
   unzip archive.zip
